     Sean: if you could send me a copy of that TV Guide piece asap, I would be
*profoundly* grateful.

     Slowly, we're starting to get noticed.  Break Magazine, out of North
Carolina, just did a very good three-page review that says B5 "has set the SF
TV world on end with the quality of its writing...stories that are gripping
and speculative...if you haven't checked out Babylon 5 you owe it to yourself
to do so.  This is, without doubt, the best science fiction series ever
produced.  Give it the next six weeks.  You'll be hooked."   (Reviewed by
staffer Tom Poston.)

     Well, after nudzhing them for the last two years, finally SFWA has given
in to Harlan's insistence about changing the Grand Master Nebula awards rules,
since we were and are on the verge of losing many of those deserving of the
honor, and why the hell can't we amend one bitty rule to give out a couple at
a time rather than once every two years?  Granted it doesn't go all the way
(and of course it wasn't in the LEAST due to outside pressure), but at least
now it'll be once a year rather than once every two years...and this comes on
a day when R.A. Lafferty has a stroke, I'm told.

     BTW, and totally unrelated (well, mostly)...Harlan will be on the Tom
Snyder show on the 17th of this month.

     I thought the size of your hands was indicative of the size of your
dish....

     The comics and novels are within B5 continuity in general, but bear in
mind you've got a LOT of different people working on these things, so some of
the finer points may vary.  In general, we're keeping it as much within our
universe as possible; but as an adjunct, not required reading, since that's
unfair to viewers.

     I'm pretty sure the pilot wings are uniform across the board.

     It's my understanding that, for instance, while the navy does not salute
uncovered, the army and air force can or do.  So we've tried to vary our
salutes (Colonel Ben Zayn and General Franklin, both army or marine types, got
salutes uncovered, for instance, while others may not).

     Funny ad in this week's BATMAN comic, for a company called French Toast,
their French Toast Profile, showing a kid and a (probably bogus) bio, listing
his name as Michael O'Heir, whose biggest wish is to meet an alien from
another galaxy, and whose goal in life is to become a Commander at NASA.

     Hmmmmmmmmmmm....

     November would be the start of year three, so it makes sense that that
would be the end of this next contract; you don't contract for a show beyond
the current season until it's been renewed.

     There are several periods of renewal, variously for B5 and PTEN per se.
One was in January; the next is in April/early May.

      I'd go for about 6.5, maybe 7 at the outside.  Which is better than last
year at this time, when it was 4 or 5.  The final word, yes/no, will probably
come in early May.

     Assuming that the panel has not yet taken place, please take this with
you and read it at the panel.

     Ahem.

     Actually, I have nothing to say, I haven't heard anything from J. Michael
Straczynski, I'm making this all up.  No, really.  I made up the part about
having a message from him.

     But if I actually HAD a message from J. Michael Straczynski, it would
probably say this: Babylon 5 has most emphatically NOT been canceled.  Our
ratings continue to improve slightly from one quarter to another, and our
demographics are nothing less than appropriately stellar.  Nothing will be
decided firmly until late April or early May, but we have real hopes for being
renewed.  Last year at this time I put the odds of renewal at 50/50; I now
place them closer to 65/35, maybe even 70/30.

     54-40 or fight.  Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too.  Bibble-bibble wah, bibble
wah wah bibble.

     That's where the message ends.  I'd just like to add a personal comment,
thanking J. Michael for clearing this up for us, and that I'll be modeling the
lace teddy I'm wearing beneath my clothes in the  Elmtree tomorrow at one
o'clock.  I would also like to know why no one on the panel looks like Ivanova
except the gentleman on the left.  And please stop that, we can see you.  I
also predict that when I sit down the entire room will burst out in applause
and laughter.

     Thank you.

     No, I'm not sitting yet.  This was only a drill.  If I were actually
sitting, I would not be quite this tall.

     Is it cold in here, or is it just me?

     Thank you for your patience.

     I'm still not done yet.

     Yes, you are.

     No, I'm not.

     I absolutely, positively, cagetorically and enthusiastically REFUSE to
sit down.

     An accident of casting.  Turhan had come in on an audition for the part
of Elric in "Geometry," but while we wanted someone with more sheer menace
(which Ansara gave us), we were just charmed out of our socks by him.  I swore
right then that I'd write a part designed just for him, and no one else.

     Unfortunately the station doesn't have the budget for that, and it's
easier to deal with what you have than pour more money into it in the hopes of
revenue down the road.  Kinda like Congress.  Also, the areas of downbelow are
mainly crummy, near the waste recycling system, the air compressors, the water
reclamation facility...not exactly choice real estate.

     I'm very happy at the reaction.  I was telling John Copeland a bit ago,
when we finished the episode, "Maybe we ought to superimpose a crawl before
the first frame of the teaser saying, "JUST IN CASE YOU THOUGHT WE WERE
KIDDING.""

     An aside on the jms/kosh discussion, for whatever interest it may
have....when Ardwight comes in to do Kosh, they call me in to direct his
performance so that it matches what the intent is now, and how it will be
interpreted later.  From where I sit in the control room, I can't see him, I
can only hear his voice.  So it's kinda like talking with Kosh there, and me
saying, "Okay, can you try 'In Fire' hitting the second word harder, and with
a sense of some anger behind it?"  And between takes, he's still in Kosh-speak
mode, muttering, "How will this end, how do I know talk to my agent...go on,
get out, buzz off...."

      Hal, the answer to your question is Yes.

      Remember that this show is wrapped around ambiguities.  I always have
had a problem with the Evil Force lurking on the edge, lusting for conquest,
looking to take over the galaxy, because then the inevitable question becomes,
"Yeah, but what do you DO with it?"  I have no patience with or interest in
cackling bad-guys.

     Once again, as with all our characters, they're set up to look one way,
so you're lulled into a sense of predictable familiarity.  "Oh, okay, now I
know who all the players are and what they're after."  Only to discover that
this ain't necessarily so.  There's a great scene in "Wrath of Khan" (if I may
be permitted a ST reference) in which the Enterprise is able to get the upper
hand because Khan is going back and forth in  his search, not up and down, not
taking advantage of the full XYZ axis.   "Two dimensional thinking," Spock
calls it.  If one wishes to hit the target there, and in this show, one must
set aside two-dimensional  thinking.

                                                                     jms

     I think Campbell was very interesting.  I have many of his books,
including those on occidental and oriental mythologies, Hero With A Thousand
Faces, others...very cogent and thought-out analyses.  I don't think, though,
that you can consciously attempt to utilize them in your storytelling, because
then you're trying to out-think yourself.  These examinations work best AFTER
the fact; otherwise it's like the centipede trying to analyze which foot goes
first.

                                                                 jms

     Actually, during WW II and the Vietnam and Korean wars, it was not at all
uncommon for base commanders and other commanders to fly missions -- even
dangerous ones -- to a) maintain the trust and respect of their pilots, b) to
survey the situation personally in order to make the right judgments on
mission objectives, and c) to maintain flight pay and full flight
classification on new equipment.  Remember, in the military, the amount of
time you spend in combat situations is *directly* proportional to career
advancement and promotion, which is why women pilots have been rightly
clamoring to be allowed into combat missions; otherwise they can't rise in the
ranks.

     Actually, what the Knight said was, "Maybe you're still inside; maybe
we're *both* still inside."

     Some tie-ins...remember Sheridan in "A Distant Star" saying that he was
feeling beached, abandoned?  His unsureness in taking on this post, what if it
was a mistake?  A number of his actions come into a clearer light once you
know he was in essence checking them all out, and putting on a hard "I'm a

     Also, I noted somewhere in a preview for upcoming episodes, among the
things coming, "conspiracies of light as well as dark."  Perhaps that is now
clearer.

     The Sanctuary is entirely a virtual set.  It's all blue-screen, no walls,
no windows, no stars, no nothing.  I made sure to ask Foundation and Mitch to
blur the walls a bit in close up to give it the correct depth of field.  (Much
of the CGI/background work is done by Mitch, our effects guy, who works
independent of Foundation, who was also the main EFX guy on Predator, ET and
others.)  Because that was a LONG scene, the rendering time was just hideous.

     The Sanctuary set has ALWAYS been entirely virtual, except for a small
grating on the floor as a marker.  The walls, the windows, all of it.
Virtual.  We've actually done this a number of times.  I haven't said anything
before because whenever I mention there's a virtual set, and where it is,
people look at it and say, "Oh, yeah, I could tell it was virtual."  Because
they knew ahead of time.  So I stopped mentioning it.

     We're sneaky that way.  You've seen, and will continue to see, sets that
don't exist ANYwhere.  Hell, you know that bazaar shot in the main title
sequence?  The second floor?  Doesn't exist.  Digital compositing and virtual
set melding.

     My two systems (at present): both are Pentiums, 32 megs ram, onboard 3x
CD Rom, external jukebox CD Rom changer, external rewriteable magneto optical
Iomega changeable drive (620 megs each), 64 bit #9GXEPro card in one system (1
meg VRAM), and 128 big Imagine card (4 megs VRAM) in the other, Supermatch 17"
(former) and Nanao 17" Flexscreen (latter), 2 gig sized hard drives in former,
1 gigabyte hard drive in the latter, plua (plus) with the other a Kinesis
ergonomic keyboard (which is actually working out), plus both have
Soundblaster 16 sound cards and enhanced IDE systems for running SCSI stuff.

     The CD is from Sonic Images, and I just finished approving the final
stages of the revised booklet inside (more pictures, including a three shot of
me, Doug and John), and having reviewed the additional suite, which is I think
about 12 minutes long, making the whole CD about 55 or 56 minutes.  It will be
hitting stores sometime in March; the first 2,000 copies right off the press
are already earmarked for the UK, to fill a backlog of orders.

     If you haven't got a copy of the soundtrack, and want one, I very
strongly suggest you go to your record store locally or contact a discount
distributer and pre-order; the limited edition went out in a flash, and while
Sonic Images can do good sized orders, they're not as fast as, say, a Warners
Records.  These things are going to fly out the door, and if they know how
many to advance produce, that'll help minimize any shortages.

     If there *were* a Self Destruct system, it would not be used if there
were any real number of civilians on board.  And even then only if it were
clear that everybody was going to die anyway, and the station needed to be
kept out of the wrong people's hands, or used to get a secondary target.

      To the Brady Bunch Theme

 It's the story
 Of a bunch of filkers
 Who simply couldn't leave B5 alone
 They were cruising
 For a bruising
 Riding the modem tone.

 It's the filking
 That drives you crazy
 With rhymes that cut you clear down to the bone
 Even more scary
 Than Mayor Barry
 It makes you groan and groan

 Till the one day the filkers met a producer
 And they knew that they were clearly out of luck
 Now this group must somehow cross the border
 Or risk assault and mayhem from a truck.

 The Filking Bunch.
 The Filking Bunch.
 Run away from the scary Filking Bunch.

     Unfortunately, I've never been able to dictate scripts.  I need to SEE
the words on the page.  A lot of what I write has a certain rhythm to the
language, and I can only see that on the page.  (People who have gotten used
to my writing can sometimes tell exactly where a jms scene appears in another
script by the rhythms.)  For me it all happens when I fall through the page.

     Normally, for things like this, the studio has rights to the actor's
likeness.  For other aspects of merchandising, like actual figures of the
actor, there is a percentage given.

     Unfortunately, many studios take advantage of the idea that there is no
such thing as a percentage of the net, since there is never (on the books) any
profit.  Case in point: in the 27+ years of Star Trek, the majority of the big
seven actors have gotten about $16,000 from all of the dolls, figurines, chess
sets and zillion other products with their faces.  This out of a billion
dollar franchise.

     The "ban" was only for the satellite viewers; now that the show has begun
to air regionally, anybody can talk about anything.

     (And it was just a request, not a ban; I don't have the power to enforce
one, and wouldn't want to do so in any event.  Common courtesy, and a
request...which was wonderfully accommodated.)

     There are some episodes coming that are about as intense as this, though
not as much *happens*, in the sense of a bunch of events affecting lots of
people in different places.

     Yes, intentional parallel structure to "Midnight," which is why I
included the shot from that episode in Londo's dream.  I like irony.

     On the chance that the datacrystal might fall into the wrong hands, I had
Sinclair deliberately avoid using Garibaldi's last name, and avoid Delenn's
altogether (since she has only the one).  The Ranger was told to deliver the
crystals at the cost of his own life if necessary...but  sometimes such orders
don't end well for the messenger.  So both messages began the same way.

     Re: the Ranger's pin...I kind of designed this, working with Ann Bruice,
our costumer.  I sketched out what I had in mind, which is two figures at
either side of the brooch, one minbari, the other human, joined and made of
the same metal, over a precious stone.

                                                                    jms

     The Rangers actually owe more to the Lone Ranger and the Texas  Rangers
in general.

     FYI, Sinclair called Delenn "old friend" as far back as the 2-hour pilot.

up.  He looks back at them..and clams up.

     I will tell you a true and secret thing, re: Londo's dream, and looking
up into a blue sky to see the ships passing overhead.

     Ever since I was a kid, I've had that image in my dreams, of standing out
in the open and looking up as strange dark ships pass overhead.  It's always
been an unnerving image, and I really wanted to use it here to see if it would
have the same effect on others.

     The other single most recurring image is to be standing at the bottom of
a long set of stairs, in a basement, and the door at the top of the stairs is
thrown open, and there's gunfire, and guards, and flares in the night beyond,
and more ships firing down.

     Don't be surprised if this shows up as well, someday....

     Which is basically deliberate.  Now we begin the process of narrowing
down these threads, and collapsing some of them, so that we see that A and B,
originally perceived as two different things, are actually aspects of the same
thing.  Since so much has been thrown out, the next episdoes after this are
kinda focused on only one or two elements at most.  You've been hit with a
lot; now's time to pull back a little and let people breathe and digest what
they've seen.  Then, as stated, you start peeling back the layers and tossing
out the red herrings so you can concentrate on the important aspects.  (And,
really, there's not *that* much, minus that pennultimate scene in Sheridan's
quarters, that isn't an extension of what has gone before...Delenn was told
that she might be dropped from the Grey Council in "Babylon Squared," and the
information about the President has been sort of there in the background ever
since Chrysalis.

     Even so, though, this concern has been anticipated, and built around.

     I doubt we'll be seeing these guys again for a long time, if ever.  So I
don't consider them on the level of certain shadows or stuff.

     They came, they grabbed, we whomped.

     Yes, Sheridan was speaking in the Drazi's native language, trying
(without success) to get through; they're a cranky species to start with, and
this didn't help.

     Sheridan learned a smattering of various languages while on patrol on the
Agamemnon.

      Pledging oneself to someone's side is not common, and carries great
significance.  From that point onward, you are bound to that person until your
death, and you must defend that person at the cost of your own life.

     Don't laugh, I actually considered that for a while; just wasn't time or
space left to do it.

     It's both; laughing at the absurdity, and crying...about as close as
we've seen to a nervous breakdown.

      Given that the Narns were agrarian prior to the arrival of the Centauri,
and were under their heel, and got most of their tech FROM the Centauri
leftovers, no, they're not more advanced.  It's a lot like the Russian
situation, seemingly this tremendous power, but once you look deep, not as
well off as they'd like you to think.

      Claudia loved the scene when I first described it to her, prior to
finishing the script.  She was dying to do it, and kept sort of "doing" it
around people for some time prior to filming.

     The Narn were not out in space prior to the Centauri arriving.

     While Paul Williams was on set for this ep, I had him sign my two CDs of
the "Phantom of the Paradise" soundtrack.  Ah, power....

Kosh.
