Langauge and words have specific meaning.

To be blacklisted means that you cannot work, cannot pursue your livelihood.

Kazan has worked successfully for his entire life.

Further, most of those prosecuted under the blacklist were totally innocent and
never did the things they were accused of doing.  No one has ever said that
Kazan didn't name names.

Subject: Re: PsiCorps 2: Deadly Relations...a readers review

I think book 2 is terrific as well, maybe in some ways better than 1 because
though it's not as epic, it really makes the Psi Corps come alive in some nifty
ways.

I haven't seen 3 yet, but it should be a real kick.

The technomage trilogy, at this point, may work out to be my favorite, given
how much of the B5 storyline it interweaves.

Nothing on cable -- nada -- gets a 10 rating.  The successful shows get
somewhere from a 1 to a 3 rating, that's it.  That's all the penetration you
can get given the number of sets that have cable.

Sliders, considered a big hit on SFC, generally gets a 1.0 rating.

1) The B5 series was never about the Psi Corps, it was about the station and
the people who live there.

2) Should the show have told everything there was about IPX, the Psi Corps,
EarthDome, and all of the various institutions involved?  Show me any series
ever created that can do that.

3) The Psi Corps books cover over a hundred years of history, and Bester's
final fate comes years after the events of the B5 storyline.  There is NO WAY
to include all of that in any one series.  You are asking the impossible, and

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Kosovo [off topic]

I go back and forth on this whole thing.  On the one hand, I think the
atrocities against the Albanian population *have* to be answered, and they
*have* to be stopped, and the only voice the Serbian leaders seem to listen to
is the voice of force.  (Though so far that doesn't seem to have happened.)

On the other hand...I think there's a qualitative difference between this and,
say, bombing Iraq, which is very much isolated from its neighbors, and has no
desire to piss off its neighbors (for the moment and only for as long as it's
in its own interest not to).  Yugoslavia is dead center of a lot of other
countries into which this conflict could spill over into something considerably
larger and more dangerous.

Let's remember that WW1 began with a single gunshot in that region.

So bottom line...I dunno, I go back and forth on an almost hourly basis. 
Basically, I think either it'll work, or it'll start a massive war in a region
noted for a resentful populace and any number of leftover nukes.

Roll the dice....

Of course you're proceeding from a false assumption.  New people get in every
year.  Every writer started out as an unknown, and not in the WGA, without a
track record.  You start trying to sell individual scripts to shows on the air
currently, then work your way up.

New members in the WGA are added every year, in substantial numbers.  Those
people all sold for the first time.  Happens all the time.

Not to flog my book...but go to your local library (cheaper that way) and check
out my Complete Book of Scriptwriting.  It may help.

All through Lane's book, he skews the facts to bolster his point of view, much
as a creationist skews the facts of science to bolster his point of view.

For instance, he makes much of the fact that we shot 6 days instead of 7 for
S5, and that this therefore led to a 1/7th decrease in quality.  Well, it
didn't affect the writing, the stories were still the stories.  I wrote just
what I would have written for a 7 day shoot.

Further, a fact he omits because it would get in the way of his argument is
that we *did* have the liberty to shoot 7 days when we thought it was
appropriate *and did so*.  (I think it was either A Tragey of Telepaths or
Phoenix Rising.)  

He omits the fact, documented through shooting schedules, that on virtually
ever episode from S1-S4, we wrapped early almost every day, sometimes by an
hour, sometimes by a couple of hours.  In 110 episodes, we had only about 20
days of serious overtime, over 5 years of shooting, and in each case the
overtime amounted to only a couple of hours here and there.  Never once had a
forced call on an actor.

Why is this important?  Because if you take an average of wrapping early 1 and
a half hours per day, over six days, you *have* a seventh day right there.

When we went to a 6 day schedule, we added about a page to each day's shoot,
and we generally didn't go home early, we wrapped on time.  (Though in fact we
were able to go home early on some days, depending on the scenes.)  That's it. 
The main burden was on the art department to turn around sets quickly enough. 
But there was no other qualitative impact otherwise.  Not one.  Zilch.

To be sure that it could be done effectively, I was the first one to do a 6 day
shoot, on Sleeping in Light, figuring that if I as a first time director could
do it, anybody could.  And we did just fine.

Anyway, that kind of bias infects the whole book, because it wasn't done the
way he would have done it, and therefore it has to be bad.  And he looks for
anything to bolster that point of view, no matter how insupportable.  It's not
just that this is his POV, it has to be the truth, and he insists that no one
can have any other point of view, or that person is an uncritical fanboy.

But it's possible to be an uncritical fanboy in a positive *and* a negative
direction.  And that is the case with the Lane book.  He does not take the
facts in a critical way, examining them on their own terms, he lines them up to
try and reflect his thesis going in.  

A person can have a bias that leads them to be blindly praising toward
something; and a person can have a bias that leads them to be blindly negative
toward something.  This is a case of the latter.

I've never had a problem with critical reviews.  Diane mentioned the B5
magazine, but if you actually look at the reviews in that magazine, many of
them do say negative things about various episodes.  Mind you this is in a
publication that's licensed, and which I could have deleted that material if
I'd chosen to.  But I let it go through, because I think we can all learn from
criticism, and if our own publication was exempt from that, then it was no
longer a proper magazine.  I gritted my teeth a lot, but it went through.

There seems to be this perception that if something says positive things, then
it isn't being critical; if it's negative, then somehow it's more objective or
critical.  This is fallacious reasoning.  Criticism should be fair and
evenhanded and constructive and, where possible, based in factual reporting.

This book is none of those things.

But that's okay, and that's the point...your feelings about the episodes are
subjective, there's no such thing as an objective *opinion*.  Facts can be
objective, opinions are a different creature.  The language means what it
means.  And you're as qualified as anyone else to give your opinion on anything
you so choose, and should not hesitate to do so.

It's when others try to disguise opinion as fact that I think a line gets

Further to your response below I can confirm that Eastern News, our news

have Babylon 5 on their shelves faster than news stands.
One area we are still trying to sort out is setting up  a North American

largely because we are a non-US magazine company. However, I hope that

I would like to thank North American readers for their patience and

We only got as far as 16, which is annoying since 14 was where we *really*

handle the rather hideous CGI that would have been involved.

The last one written, 16, synchronistically enough, was entitled "End of the

Just for the record: I think the first one -- the only one written directly at
TNT's behest -- is probably the weakest one, certainly the one I find least
interesting.  It's lumbered with buckets of exposition, explaining things that
don't need explaining, too many fights, too many explosions, too much
swaggering around, all stuff the net wanted. 

Then we go back to the show we wanted to make...Path of Sorrows is terrific,
Well of Forever is a solid character story, The Long Road is just pure fun
(that's pretty much reverse broadcast order, btw)...there's one or two in the
bunch that are a bit slower than I'd like, but those are the exception rather
than the rule.

Not entirely true.  The 20 pages of notes we got that were truly offensive were
turned down by me.

But they kept after us on other stuff on a daily basis.  They wanted Dureena's
makeup softened, on the theory that it was a cliche if she actually *looked*
like an alien...they kept making demands of other scripts, including revisions
in such already finished scripts as "Well" that weakened the script...

What I said was that "War Zone" was the only one written at TNT's behest, not
that they didn't have input into the rest of them.  It was only with
"Appearances" that I finally hit the wall and simply stopped taking their
notes.

Every day there was a campaign of attrition and the constant threat that if
things weren't done, either the first shut-down would be permanent, or there
would be another shut-down.  The show was essentially held hostage.

I think that there's more positive than negative in all the episodes aired, and
I'm proud of what we did under the conditions under which we had to labor; but
understand that their fingerprints are on all of the first 8 to various
degrees.  I separated War Zone from the rest because structurally, that's a
story I would never have told if there wasn't a gun to my head.

The only episodes totally free of interference are the first 5 shot.

Let me ask you a real simple question:

What makes you think it was my decision?

TNT wanted the "new-look" episodes aired first.  They wanted to push the first
5 back as far as possible.  I initially figured we'd do 5-6 of the "new look"
ones first, the minimum possible, then the first 5, then the new-look (black
uniform) ones to the end.

TNT *mandated* that the black-uniform ones would go first.  It was not my
choice.  I have NO control over broadcast.  

Not only did they want to hold them back, they were debating if they'd even
allow us to FINISH post on the first 5.  It was a struggle to let them finish
'em, and they were the last ones to go through post.

Before you fire, it's always a good idea to know what the target is first.

Yeah, we plan to sell a number of B5 scripts in chronological order, for a
limited period, one or so per month.  What that means is: we'll take orders on
a script such as the Gathering from September 1 to the end of the month.  Then
we'll print up only as many copies as have been ordered.  That's it.  Then we
move to the next one.  It'll probably take years before it would cycle through
all the scripts we make available before we got back to the Gathering again. 
So when they're gone, for all intents and purposes, they're gone.

My feeling is that each kind of writing you do makes you better at another kind
of writing, therefore it behooves you to do it all, if at all possible. 
Writing an article teaches you structure, which you use in a screenplay; a
screenplay teaches you dialogue which you use in a short story; a short story
teaches you narrative structure which you can apply to novels...and so on.

It's all meant to be a learning experience.  It's when you stop learning that
the trouble starts.

There's several differences.  You're getting the acutal physical *script*, not
a published version OF a script, the real deal.  

Second, the Art of Star Wars published several hundred thousand copies of that
script; collector's value is zero.  We will be putting out, at most, a few
hundred copies of each one.  The rarer something is, the more it costs, and the
greater its value.

Third, the $25 price ($20 for an episode) is equal to or less than what is
charged by script houses.

Fouth, unlike these script houses that copy scripts unlawfully and never pay a
dime to the author or the studio, all the B5 authors whose scripts we publish,
like Larry or David or DC or others, will get a 10% commission on the sales.

Actually, I'm not disillusioned.  Disappointed, sure, in how TNT chose to treat
the show...but understand that a 5 year run is the anomaly in TV, even more so
in SF.  B5 was the first non-Trek space-based SF series to go more than 3
seasons in 30 years.  So the record ain't great.

But if anything, I've been just as busy on other projects since Crusade ended,
and all of it is what Crusade was not during the last half-year of its
production: they're fun again.  I'm enjoying myself, and that's what I got into
this thing for in the first place.

Not at all (and I still don't consider it a franchise; how can it be a
franchise if it's not continuing?).

What I was told by those involved is that SiL did not air in Australia during
or before the voting period; it did not, in fact, finally air until after the
WorldCon itself was over by three days.  And the majority of folks coming to
WorldCon were, of course, Australians.  So they didn't *see* the episode to
vote for it.  

I would not expect, or want, anyone to vote for the episode sight-unseen.  To
do so means you've missed the point of the show.

Truman Show (a damned good movie and well worth the award, btw) was written by
a New Zealander, and directed by an Australian, so was the next logical choice.


Once I knew that SiL wasn't going to air until after the Hugos, I pretty much
knew it wouldn't get the Hugo.  (As it was, according to the site with all the
official  numbers, SiL did get more raw numbers of votes than any other
nominee, but due to the Australian balloting system, which uses a weighted
scale, TS got the actual award.)

And I note that the question is phrased in your usual negative fashion, and
frankly, I heard from many folks who said that S5 was their favorite season,
and there's a great editorial in Frontier (the main SF magazine in Australia
and a fine publication) that sang the praises of S5 as necessary and right.

Subject: The Gathering Script Available

Yesterday I was reading over the original script for "The Gathering," which we
are making available via thestation.com for this month only.  (Everything that
goes through for sale has to be approved by me personally, and I wanted to make
sure the copy was solid and readable, it's been a long time, after all.)  And
for those who've asked -- and I should've gotten to this before, it's just been
kinda nuts -- it does have scenes that were filmed and didn't make it into
either version of the aired pilot movie for reasons of length, and some scenes
and partial scenes that were not filmed at *all.*  I was actually kinda
surprised at just how much there was (including two very funny scenes with
Garibaldi and a tiny drunk alien in the Zocalo bar that we couldn't shoot
because the mechanical props kept breaking down).

Anyway, to those who've asked, yes, there's a pretty goodly amount of new stuff
there (well, new to anyone who never saw the script).  It was amazing to look
back at it all, after 7 years, and see it in script form again; haven't touched
it since we did the re-edit.

To finish:

>That is their opinion and that is fine, however, the fact is that, honestly

>of the shows run.

To repeat...if someone else says they like it, then that's their opinion, but
when you say something, it's the facts, right?  That's what you're saying here.

Please give me the facts and figures to back this up, because it ain't what I
hear at conventions, and it ain't reflected in the only -- ONLY -- objective
form of reportage on B5's history: the P5 poll.  

In the P5 poll, in which 2,403 people voted on episodes over the 5 year history
of B5, the rankings are as follows, by season:

PILOT: 6.32
S1: 7.52
S2: 8.11
S3: 8.38
S4: 8.58
S5: 8.35

With a standard deviation of .61, which means that the S5 rating could be as
high as 9.  The .23 difference between S4 and S5 is statistically insignificant
on every conceivable level, and even without that, the pilot, S1 and S2 ALL
rated below S5 in the poll and it's essentially identical to S3.

I've shown my homework, now you show yours.  Some people take it as read,
because THEY didn't like it, that everybody else feels the same way (and I've
heard from a LOT of people who very much liked S5 but just got tired of being
shouted down by a few fanatics and stopped posting).  Again, the facts do NOT
bear out your -- and I emphasize this word -- OPINION.  Sorry, but you do not
have the key to unvarnished truth, only to your opinion, which is flatly and
provably WRONG.

So the facts definitely contradict you, as they tend to so often in your posts,
from your claim through a "friend" that Harlan drinks, to this, to not knowing
or understanding how the Hugo system works before criticizing it...it's a
definite pattern on your part.

I'm sorry it's taken me this long to reply to this, but every time I see the

Talking about errors in logic...once again, Von Bruno, you demonstrate your
own, in the most glaring way imaginable.  It's the ultimate topper to your
preceding inaccuracies.  This one is so massive and expansive that it's just
breathtaking.

Do you know *anything* about polling or public opinion measurement?  Before you
answer, let me save you the time: no.  I do.  I have a degree in clinical
psychology and a second degree in sociology, and as part of that had to take
any number of specialized courses in polling and public opinion measurement.

And here's where your logic falls down utterly.  Let me requote the above:

>> There are three kind of lies. Lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Yes,
>> but there is an error in the logic JMS. You have more viewers towards
>> the end of the poll then you did at the begining. (Season 1 had fewer
>> people then season two and so on and so forth).

The more people you have in a poll, THE MORE ACCURATE IT IS.  The fewer people,
the less accurate.  That utterly incontestable fact is at the core of every
poll ever taken.  That's why they usually show you the raw numbers ("In a poll
of two thousand people, ten percent thought Mars was not a planet but a candy
bar").

So the very element you claim made it LESS accurate in fact made it
statistically MORE accurate.

Just once, could you try to actually *know* something about what we're
discussing here?  Do just a *little* homework from time to time?  Because right
now, you're 0 for 5 on basic facts, just in the last round.

And by the way, this is probably the last time I'm going to respond to you.  I

What I was responding to was the statement that more responses made a survey
*less* accurate.  Surely you're not saying that that's the case?  And yes, a
larger sampling universe *does* make a survey more accurate within that
preselected universe.  As long as the sampling within that universe is random
-- and there's a wide range of diversity withih that preselected universe --
the survey is accurate.

For instance, phone surveys preselect anyone who has a phone.  At one point,
there were still not a lot of phones in common use in the hinterlands, but that
doesn't disqualify the poll.  A street corner poll preselects those who happen
to be walking by the street corner.

Now, if you're going to preselect for some particular specific variable -- all
asians, for instance, or only people under 25 -- then you start to skew the
data and thus the results, making it inapplicable to the greater, non-sampled
universe.

Point is, insisting that more numbers make a sample *less* accurate -- as VB
was doing -- is utterly and totally inaccurate.

I don't, basically, as the whole TNT situation makes fairly evident.  I'm
simply not a political creature.  My life would be eminently simpler and less
stressful if I *were*, but I ain't.  I go for the philosophy of "Be sand, not
oil, in the machinery of the world."

The peculiar thing about it is...by all rights I should be hard-core
unemployable.  But any time I become available, the phone rings...people who
work with me invariably come back to work with me again,fully knowing that I'm
a major-league pain in the ass.  I think the reason they do so is because they
know that I'm *not* political, that whatever some might say the truth is that
when I show up at the office in the morning, I check my ego at the door and
everything I do, I do if I sincerely believe it's the best thing for the show,
and the story.

Somehow, it works.  Damned if I understand it.

Subject: Re: B5: Into the Fire Cancelled

Yeah, I got word of this today from one of the developers on the game;
apparently the problem is two-fold: 1) because Sierra has taken so long to get
the game out, it has become expensive, and the additional million bucks used to
relocate the facility north (and everyone involved) was charged against the
game, and 2) they made a deal with WB for X number of games in Y years, and
they've chewed up most of that time already, and WB is (I'm told, haven't had a
chance to verify this yet) loathe to renegotiate since it's now taken --what?--
three, four years to get this first game out.  

There's rumors that another studio might be interested in picking it up and
finishing it off -- it was literally inches from being finished, and it's a
spectacular game -- but again that's only rumor, I don't know anything beyond
that.

(The game would have allowed players to go through all of the major wars of the
B5 universe -- the Dilgar War, the Earth/Minbari War, the Shadow War and the
Earth Civil War -- with a chance of affecting the outcomes and dealing with the
temporal stresses caused by that.)

Except, of course, that a number of conventions use the charity flag to cover a
multitude of sins, often illegitimately...which also compromises the cons that
ARE sincerely raising money for charity.  And that a con is giving money to a
charity doesn't really mitigate the legalities involved; if I steal your car,
sell it, and give the money to charity, the government isn't going to go
"awwww" and let it go because the money ended up in a worthwhile cause.

A secondary concern is that if ANY kind of money is involved, for a group
screening, it can be legally constituted as a theatrical exhibition if any of
the actors or others involved choose to press the point.  In fact, that
happened to WB, after an episode of Lois and Clark was screened at a con.  One
of the actors apparently took the position that this was a theatrical
exhibition, and if you show a TV program in a theatrical venue, it triggers
*substantial* payments per the various unions involved...and in this particular
case, it cost WB in the vicinity of six figures.

Invariably, whenever I show up at a convention flying the colors, the #1
question I get is about the B5 cast and crew jacket.  "Where can we get one of
those?"  Up until now, the answer has always been the same: you can't.

For JUST this month, that will change: we are making a limited number (only
about 200) of these same jackets available on www.thestation.com.  These are
identical to the crew jackets, made by the same manufacturer, same materials,
same detailed embroidery, the whole thing.  On ebay these jackets have gone
from anywhere from $400-$1000, which is kind of obscene, but these are
available here for a hell of a lot less.

Also: we stopped taking orders for The Gathering script, which is now out of
print until some point in the distant future.  We're doing one per month, so
for those who missed out...it's too late.  This month it's the script for the
first B5 episode, "Midnight on the Firing Line."  Orders will be taken for this
month, and that's it.

>Tallman's afterword in Andy Lane's The Babylon File Vol. 2 confirms the

The problem with that is the way it was presented.

An actor has a fee he or she receives for a full week's work.  Let's say, for
the sake of argument, it's 7,000 for a 7 day shoot, only because that will make
the math simpler.  If you only need an actor for one or two days, it's typical
that you only pay the actor for the one or two days of work.  If it's more than
that, you generally pay full freight, seven days, $7,000.

We did this with Richard Biggs, who didn't have a problem with it, as most
don't.  When we went to shoot "Path," we only needed Pat for one day. 
Actually, it would've been only a partial day, 3 scenes.  Out around lunchtime.
 So we offered a day rate.  She wanted a full week's salary.  We couldn't do
that.  End of story.

No animosity, no acrimony, we had what we had, and that didn't work out.  But
it is utterly consistent with how all TV is done.

Thing is, the war is too big and too important to slip into what is, basically,

'B5': Back B4 U Know It?
by Andy Patrizio

3:00 a.m. 20.Oct.99.PDT
The dedicated fans of a game based on the Babylon 5 television series are doing
their level best to find a new home -- and life -- for their favorite pastime. 

When Sierra announced in September that it was killing off three games --
including "Babylon 5: Into the Fire" -- as part of a massive reorganization
that
included 105 layoffs, angered fans went bonkers. 

"A lot of people wanted to take out the Sierra servers and do other things to
try and take Sierra out of the business," said Kevin MacNeil, aka Drazi Guy,
one
of the three coordinators of the FirstOnes.Com, a fan site that had been
following development of the game. 

"It took about a week to get everyone under control and to get ourselves
coordinated and decide what direction we were going to
head," he said. 

The plan was to spread the news of the game's demise to every gaming site and
Babylon 5 fan out there. It proved to be an effective
tactic. 

One editor for a gaming publication said he'd received more than 2,000 emails
on
the issue. Wired News has also been flooded with feedback from upset B5 fans. 

Another target was game developers, and that campaign has also paid off. 

"There are four companies who have shown interest in purchasing B5. We are now
in discussions with all of them," said Dave Williamson, Sierra's senior vice
president of business development. "Some have reviewed what we've got and some
are in the process of scheduling meetings with us. So, we are actively pursuing
the opportunities." 

The B5 team members, who were all laid off together, bonded quickly with the
FirstOnes crew. "They have been a great help for the team as far as morale,
when
it all first happened," lead programmer Dan Foy said. 

Foy has been in the games industry for 10 years and has never seen anything
like
the FirstOnes' effort. "The show's popularity is certainly a part of it," he
said. 

Another reason for the loyalty is that the developers took an active role in
the
FirstOnes forums to discuss nuances of the game. "People really enjoyed
participating with us and took it more personally when the project was
cancelled," said Foy. 

Even though the B5 team has a good severance package from Sierra, the crew is
eager to renew work on the project. Foy said they need a pretty clear picture
on
a possible buyer within a month or they'll start losing members to other jobs.
At that point, a new team will have to be rebuilt, which would delay the game
even further. 

He described the game as 65 percent complete. The engine is pretty much done,
but artificial intelligence and some missions still needed work. 

The FirstOnes faithful continue their work as well. A Web ring dedicated to
spreading word of the game and trying to find a new publisher has sprung up. So
far it has 16 member sites. Petitions to find a new publisher have almost 600
signatures, and the message board on FirstOnes.com has 700 users posting to it.


How long will they carry the torch? "We're going to hold out until the
development team has moved on to other projects and there's no hope left," said
MacNeil.

I've been about as busy since Crusade as during it.  In addition to the comic
(which is going great guns, but the schedule is a bit off, about which I've had
some talks with the good folks at Top Cow), and the series project which is
currently in rather serious development mode....

There's the TV movie script I recently finished for CBS...the adaptation of CM
Kornbluth's "The Marching Morons" for NPR's Beyond 2000 radio series...I
finished a novel outline now being sold in NY...I have a feature film in
development that's now in script stage...I knocked down two of the B5 stories
in Amazing Stories Magazine (with one coming out this month and another due
from me in December)... the ongoing column in B5 Magazine...in the next little
bit I should finally conclude a deal for an original computer game I've
designed (have both a developer and a publisher who want to do it)...the bulk
of the original B5 novel outlines were written after Crusade was
completed...and there's been a bunch of other stuff.

But the main thing that's consumed my time has been the series development,
which has just recently begun to show signs of maybe some good news coming,
though I can't say anything more about it at this point.

Suffice to say, though, it's been kinda hectic around here for the last few
months.

It's an ephemeral medium but a pervasive one; it hits millions of people at a
time.  A best selling novel reaches 100,000 people or so; at its worst, the
average B5 episode was seen by 10 *million* people here in the US alone.  If
the task of the writer is to tell stories to the largest number of people, then
TV gives you that ability.

And why abandon such a powerful and pervasive medium to the visigoths?

Exactly, which is why I chose to examine that particular question in the story;
I like questions that don't have particularly easy or facile answers.  And this
is one of them.

There isn't any hard and fast rule.  For instance: in recent years there were
two particular cases of self-immolation here in the US, both as protest but
also both were just a little bit not right in the head.

Anyway...in one case, the reporter saw what was happening, and rolled film,
made no attempt to intervene.  He was pilloried for his inaction and
inhumanity.  In the other case, the other reporter saw what was happening,
grabbed a coat, and rushed to put the fire out...and was pilloried for getting
personally involved with the story instead of staying the "objective outsider,"
which in truth does not exist because the only way to be TRULY objective is to
not have any prior beliefs, convictions or experiences that would color one's
perceptions.  

I don't think there is a right answer or perspective on the question...which
makes it fun to explore as a writer.

Between shows, I work at my home office.  I travel light, don't have a lot of

anywhere else.  I have a home office equipped with phone, fax, modem,
computers, reference books, music, TV, every distraction I could ask for.

My office was in the B5 production building/studio in Sun Valley, at the end of
the hall, bordering the Wall of Death (a wall where all the generators and
power sources were, which was on the other side of the wall right behind
mydesk...and for a studio we're talking a LOT of power...I didn't think much of
it until we had an eletrician do an EMF sweep, came to the wall (where I sat
every day for 3 years) and literally paled.  HIs comment, "Jesus, you could fry
eggs over here."  So I moved to the other side of the office, and a lot of the
fatigue I'd had for the preceding couple of years faded.)

Live, no...about 20 minutes away.  My office was about 15 feet from Stage C.

Constant personal contact.  We'd eat together at lunch, I'd go by the stage
whenever possible (and often it wasn't) to watch scenes being shot, we
sometimes would get dinner or otherwise hang out.

Yes.  It is extremely cluttered -- frighteningly so -- but I know where

This is a greyer question than appears at first blush.

You need to understand that the notes-giving process was ongoing, that every
day was a fight, and every day there were pressures from WB and others to
accede to those requests and notes.  We were told repeatedly, "Look, give 'em
the show they want for the first year, then you can make it your way in the
second season."  

I've always had a policy that if a note makes sense, whoEVER it comes from -- a
network, a grip, a carpenter, whoever -- then I'll listen to it.  So I tried,
where possible, to listen for any notes that made sense in the whirlwind of
ka-ka that came our way.  Some who were not there said that I was acting
unreasonably, and that only the one script WarZone was really affected, that
the other scripts were already written and thus not affected.  But nothing
could be further from the truth.  They were all whittled at in big or small
ways.

If a note didn't make sense...then the answer had to be No.

The "big no" meeting was specifically about a small percentage of the
scripts...and only one meeting out of many.  They kept at us *constantly*.  

As Michelangelo said, "Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle." 
Sometimes the notes nibbled at big issues, sometimes at small ones, but there
are profound effects either way.  Sometimes doing something as small as
changing the rhythm of a scene can destroy it.  Take a particularly memorable
piece of classical music (I won't even name it to illustrate the point further)
that begins "dah-dah-dah-DAAAH."  

Now change it to "dah-dah-dah-BLAAAT."  It's only one note difference.  You can
say it' s just a teensy change.  But your gut says it ain't right, something
there doesn't work.  

Just for the hell of it...I'm going to reprint now one of my memos to TNT,
omitting the name of the person involved.  This is emblematic of some of the
exchanges.  (This memo was widely distributed to TNT, WB and Babylonian folks
involved in the creative stuff, so it's by no means private.)

Message follows.

Re:	Latest Notes on Cuts and Scripts

Dear 

We've had a chance to review the latest batch of comments, and have some
thoughts on how some of them can be done.  Others, as will be examined below,
are more problematic.

Prior to that, though, a general thought: when the notes process began in
earnest subsequent to 105, we voiced the concern that we seemed to be getting
conflicting reactionson the one hand we received requests for action, on the
other hand we got requests for more dialogue about what the stories mean to the
characters, scenes that allow them to express their feelings to one another. 
Prior to then, with the possible exception of a few scenes in 101, we had been
primarily an action-based series.

We said at this time that we needed clarification: did TNT want more action, or
more dialogue scenes/exposition?  Since then, the script notes have been
primarily oriented toward creating more dialogue scenes, more background on the
characters, their feelings toward one another and the situations they're in,
and the emotional consequences.  Essentially, expository scenes of one sort or
another.  We have complied with those notes as much as we possibly could.

So you can understand my concern when, having done as TNT asked, we get notes
on the cuts that essentially pillory us for having a slower pace.  The pace is
in large measure the result of adding in those expository scenes.  If TNT asks
for new scenes or to expand scenes in which characters talk about their
feelings, it's going to perforce slow down the action aspect.  

I feel it's unfair to take us to task for doing what we were told to do.

The Senator scene in 108 is particularly emblematic of this.  That scene was
originally much shorter.  TNT asked for more information about how this was
affecting people back home, how they felt about it.  We did that, and now are
being told that the scene is too long.  It wasn't too long when we started with
it.  It only became too long after we added in all the things that TNT asked us
for.

It is both confusing and demoralizing for all of us involved in the production
of Crusade to receive contradictory notes.  As I mentioned in our previous
meetings, there has to be consistency; if the goal post keeps getting moved
around the field, we have no idea what to move toward.

To be honest, the pacing that the current notes seem to be asking for is most
embodied by episodes 101-105, the kind of show we were making prior to the
hiatus and notes process.  

Anyway, that's a general reaction that I think we need to address at some point
in the future.  Meanwhile, on to the specific notes.

NOTES ON PRODUCER'S CUTS

(jms note to reader: a producer's cut is made after the episode has been filmed
and we edit the thing.)

THE WELL OF FOREVER

"The opening seems slow.  Is there a way to open with the scene in which Galen
convinces the crew to go to the Well of Forever?  This scene will catch the
attention of the audience."

There are only two scenes in the opening: a walk-and-talk scene with Matheson
and Gideon, in which we learn that Matheson is going to get tested to ensure
that he has not been improperly scanning people telepathically, and the
convince-the-crew scene.  The most we could do structurally would be to flop
the two scenes in sequence.

Both are dialogue scenes.  The first one keeps us in motion, and sets up that
Gideon is en route to a meeting; the second scene is that meeting.  We cannot
edit out that part because it comes at a point where the camera is moving and
we're well into the scene.  It seems to us best to start in on movement, to
pull the audience in, and end on the conference scene, because that sets up the
mystery: no one has ever come back.  To have that moment, and then the
walk-and-talk, would eliminate the dramatic end of the teaser, which we're
hoping to use to make the audience want to come back after the commercial
break.

So on careful reflection, this one can't really be done without actually
working against the overall pacing and structure of the episode.

WAR ZONE

'The pacing of this episode, as well as 106 and 107, is consistently slow."

While there may be some validity to this as far as 106 is concerned, about
which more later, I find "slow pacing" a very difficult concept to apply to
this episode.  

WAR ZONE contains 25 interior shots, 52 exterior shots, and a total of 115
scenes over 43 pages, averaging 3 scenes or major shots per page, which is
something of a record for a script on this or just about any other show.  It
has stunts, fights, hand-to-hand combat, air-to-air combat, air-to-ground
combat, sneaking, shooting, and buckets of other action.  It is, frankly, the
most ambitious and fastest-paced episode we've ever produced, rivaled only by
103, which is in your hands now, and which is anything but slow.

I believe that, as with 103, the pacing will become more evident once the CGI
and other effects are in. 

"The fight scene in the openingis choppy and unrealistic."  We did the best we
could there with what we had in the dailies, which were also sent to TNT.  It
was a small set, and we really only have the two scenes with which to play.  

However:

 I agree that there are some places where a couple of transitional shots (such
as the downshot, and the crew running out the door coming into the stairwell
scene) are a bit awkward, given the coverage we had.  We jumped into the scene
a bit faster because we wanted to speed up the pacing, get into the
confrontation with Gideon quickly, rather than wait for them to start at the
top of the stairs and come all the way down.  

 We can try to further expand the fight by lengthening the first piece, but
only by double-cutting some of the footage we have from B-camera and grabbing
bits of side-action, but this will add more cuts and that may also make it more
"choppy."  

 If you want additional fight stuff for that scene, it would have to be shot
as new material, and there will be costs involved in doing that.

"the scenes which include the senator's speeches need to be cut back."  As
noted previously, this scene was expanded to meet TNT's earlier notes. 
Virtually all of the information presented here is necessary for the audience
to understand what the show is about: the plague, the blockade, why Gideon was
chosen, and what the mission is. 

 However: there is a small piece or two that can be lifted, about 5-15 seconds
worth, which may help to pick up the pacing.  It would, however, mean
eliminating some of the material asked for in earlier notes.  So if TNT is okay
with that, we can trim up the scene and add those seconds to the fight scene in
the teaser.

If "unrealistic" could be better defined for us, that would be very helpful,
because that one has us kind of stumped.

 One other thing we can do in future episodes that will help the pacing is to
work more closely with the directors, who tend to loved their long panning
shots to open up a scene, rather than just jumping into it.  (We sometimes get
stuck with those long pans because coverage tends to start later into the
scene, leaving us unable to cut into the scene any later.)   

"Gideon doesn't seem to have an understanding or a rapport with his ship."

So that I can better understand the note, at what point does Gideon indicate
that he doesn't understand his ship?  

As for "a rapport with his ship," in this episode he is assigned to the
Excalibur for the first time.  He's only been there for a few hours; it seems
unrealistic to expect to build a rapport with a place in just a few hours.

"There are also logic problems.  How does he know where the conference room is
on the Excalibur without some investigating?"

In the first Excalibur scene, Matheson escorts Gideon to the bridge.  Gideon
can see the conference room from his chair.  Since it is in his clear line of
sight, I'm not sure how much further investigation is required in order to find
it.

"Introduce Trace by name earlier."

 We don't have any footage of this, but we can add an ADR line using his name.

Regarding the Chambers scenehere we must agree to disagree.  Her letter to her
sister seems very emotional to everyone here and at WB.  Further, it's not a
crying scene because that scene is about encouraging her sister about their
intention to find a cure.  She has to be strong for her sister, not fall apart.
 This had to be done as a recorded letter to her sister because we couldn't
afford another actor at that point.

Also, that scene was sent through in script, and everyone was fine with it at
the time.

Regarding 106 and 107as we noted in our conversation prior to their
publication in script form, having done massive action shows in 101-105, we
needed to have a couple of smaller, quieter shows in order to balance out the
costs involved.  So yes, they are slower episodes, as I noted at the time they
would be.  You can't produce every episode at a screaming pace and expect to
stay on budget.  Some are loud, some are quiet; the key is just to do more
louds than quiets.

SCRIPT NOTES

(jms note to readers: this refers to scripts that were then in the
preproduction stage)

APPEARANCES AND OTHER DECEITS

"Can we have one of our primary characters become inhabited by the being
instead of either Rice or Janey?"

This is not possible; in order to provide the solution to the problem, we need
Chambers, Eilerson and Matheson outside, and free.  I chose those individuals
specifically because they're the ones who together work out the solution.  If
you take any of them out of the equation, you don't have the people necessary
to resolve this.  So they can't become inhabited.

If we choose another character from our roster of regulars, that means a
substantial rewrite and increased cast costsand we have further problems
because we only have access to a limited number of episodes per cast member,
and we're trying to spread them out for maximum effect.  So this one we can't
really do.

"It might be fun to play up the comedy with (the fashion consultant)have him
get the crew into more trouble, not out of it."

That would be kind of the clich way to go, in my view; to have him even
inadvertently help the process is a nice surprise.  Also, to create a thread
where we have to set up a third problem in the script (the changes being asked
for by Earth being one, the infestation being the second) and pay it off
requires more room than we have in 43 pages, and is an unnecessary beat.

"Can we heighten the crew's annoyance with the changes being made on the ship?"
 The changes are not actually made until the end of the episode, which makes
this rather problematic.  We can add material in which they voice their
concerns about what might be done, but this will again add expository dialogue
that will slow down the pacing of the episode, and that seems to contradict
what we are being asked for elsewhere.

 Re: "decoding of 'the air is human,'"I'll look at that and see if we can
extend the discovery of what he's trying to communicate to make it clearer
about how they get there.  Be advised, again, that this will add time and
exposition and slow the pace.

RULING FROM THE TOMB

Regarding the recap of the request to edit down the Jehanne dialogue on page
13, expressed at the time because it seemed too "far out"as noted later in the
script, we are using the actual dialogue of Joan of Arc in the script.  So if
we are to retain our historical accuracy, we can't really change that material.

"Henderson's murder at the end of the teaser needs to have more physical
actionhave it become more of a hand-to-hand struggle."

We have already had to pull back on some of the stunt work in that episode due
to budget limitations, and adding one more here is not within the limits of
what we can do.  Also, the suddenness of the attack is what we're looking for,
dramatically, rather than a prolonged struggle with someone we've never met.

 However, I've spoken with John Copeland about this (he's directing this
episode), and he will do what he can to maximize the action of that scene
without having to add stunts or other costly elements.

I hope that this will be of assistance in clarifying the situation.  We will
certainly try and do what we can in the areas where we indicated we have some
room to work, but as always, the degree to which we can make modifications is
dictated to us by the budget, and we have an obligation to both WB and TNT to
stay within those limits.

Sincerely,

Joe Straczynski

********************************

Back again.

Hardly the picture of someone who is being hostile, I'd say.  But it does show
that the notes process was ongoing.  Every script meant defending against the
addition of exposition and dumb scenes (such as a scene in which Matheson shows
Gideon where the conference room is, which is 10 feet from his chair, because
somebody at TNT thought it would be confusing to the audience otherwise to
figure out how he could know it's there.)

>Meaning, you'd be pretty damn proud of those episodes [The Path of Sorrows,
>Patterns of the Soul, Rules of the Game, ect.] that were only slightly
>changed?
>

I'm proud of pretty much all of them, because of what they required.  If
someone hands you a palm frond, a blender, and a car battery, and says, "Make
me a radio out of this," and you actually DO it, you're proud of the result. 
It ain't as pretty as it could be, but given the conditions under which you
were laboring, it ain't bad.

Some succeed more than others; but all would have been better *without* the
kind of interference we received, the day to day battles, the war of attrition,
the confusing and contradictory notes, and so on.

That's why 101-105 are overall the best episodes, because they were troubled
the least by outside forces.

That was *precisely* the problem.  The LA office wanted the exposition stuff,

Simple answer: TNT Atlanta had never gotten involved before.  Also, B5 was a
known commodity, it was never a question of getting input on the direction of
the show, we just kept doing what we'd been doing.  Crusade was a new show, and
people who didn't understand SF wanted a hand in determining the direction of

Except at first TNT said they wanted NO connection to B5, or as little as
possible, because they wanted it to be THEIR show...then, after they began to
realize that the connection made sense (well into the writing process, I might
add), they said no, no, it's OKAY to have B5 stuff going on...which is why
Lochley is gone for so long.

Alyson: that's a very good analysis of the situation.

>Compounded on this dynamic seems to be an additional one of lack of

>can affect the product.

This is also very much true.  In one scene we shot, there's a slight reflection
on the monitor wherein we can see Gideon's face reflected.  (Intentional on the
director's part.)  They asked if we could give them the scene without the
reflection.  No, we can't...unless we reshoot it.

One other area where we ran up against a  problem with understanding was on the
EFX and delivery.  They simply couldn't visualize what was going into a CGI
shot before we actually *did* it.  They'd look at a scene where we'd slugged
time for action, and think it was slow, because no, there isn't anything there
NOW, but there will be when the CGI is done.

They also kept saying (after the first 5) that the show was too dark, that they
couldn't see anything, that the colors were muted.  That's one reason they
wanted the sets repainted, to make them more colorful.  We kept saying, no,
it's NOT too dark, we don't know where you're getting that.

I finally found out when I went to visit someone at TNT and looked at what THEY
were looking at...not the digibeta footage, or a good clean copy of the
edit...they were looking at a fourth- or fifth-generation dub of the *avid
output*, which is a digitized version of the film, somewhat low-res.  

So finally, we brought in their tech guy, and showed him the digital beta
version, the actual footage.  He looked at it, and said, "Oh, okay, you're
right, it's not dark at all."  But by then the mandate had come down from on
high, LIGHTEN THE SCENES.  Which is why the first five have a moodier, more
stylistic look to them than the rest.

No...it's just that there really aren't any, in terms of story.  The very few

Well, I don't really know if that's necessarily true of Chris, I think he
always tries to be straightforward with folks.

I think you have to be careful to always be as accurate as possible.  (And bear
in mind that one of the whole reasons for this exchange is to provide an
accurate transcript of how a show is made, to help folks better understand the
process and thus get better TV and have more input into that process...and that
process is compromised if bad data is entered into the system.)

I take some small pride in the fact that in 6 years of having this on-line
conversation, when it comes to talking about this show, I have never once been
caught out in a prevarication.

Which is why I was kinda frustrated when the whole Claudia Christian situation
went down, when she was saying she was fired when in fact she walked away over
money.  People said "Well, who should we believe here?"  At that moment, to be
honest, it felt to me like, "Why have I bothered to establish this reputation
and conversation all this time if suddenly my word doesn't mean anything?" 
Later, of course, Claudia came out and said, well, yeah, she did walk away, and
it was over money, which is of course utterly her right, I just wish she'd said
that at the start rather than much later...since the situatoion led to threats
against me and abusive email and the like.

So really, some people will believe what they choose to believe no matter how
straight you've been with them in the past...that's been a hard lesson that
I've had to learn.  All I can do is to keep doing what I've been doing, talking
straight about the show to the best of my knowledge and ability.  And if I'm
wrong about something, I cop to it instantly.

What's good about that is that if I think a show didn't live up to
expectations, I'll *say* so...quite bluntly sometimes.  But that way, when I
say that show X is really, really *good*...fans know I ain't blowing smoke up
their collective butts.

I said as straight as I can be about what happens in the show on the production
side to within my knowledge and ability.  That means mainly what happens behind
the scenes.  I a) consider the cameo to be a story thing, and b) what was I to
say to that question?  "Oh, yes, I intend to be in the last episode shutting
off the lights before B5 blows up"...?  That would be a massive spoiler.  And

That's simply not true.  For one thing, the few ads they had on TNT were comps,
meaning they don't cost much of anything, and only appeal to viewers watching
TNT to begin with.  For the B5 launch, they bought ads on other cable networks,
bus ads, billboards, you name it...they did none of that for Crusade.  Zero. 
Reviewers and journalists were constantly calling me to ask if they could get
material for the show because TNT wouldn't give it to them.  I saw their ad
campaign before they launched it, and even they admitted that it was only a
small part of what they'd done for B5 and were doing for other shows.

Your perception is your perception, but it doesn't jibe with the facts.

Subject: Finally! B5 Bible/Treatment Available!

Folkses:

For the last six years, I've been asked repeatedly -- in email and at
conventions -- "Are you ever going to make the original B5 series writers'
bible available?"  My general reaction was to simply say...maybe someday.

After considerable reflection, and as a Solstice present to B5 viewers...we're
finally going to make it available.

TWO such *its*, to be precise.

First: The original Babylon 5 Series Treatment

This is the 23 page document, written in September 1988, that was used to sell
the series for the five years it took to find a buyer.  It has different
characters than were ever seen in the show, such as Dr. Chakri Mendak (a role
that later became Dr. Stephen Franklin) and more background on Vice-Commander
Laurel Chang... Sinclair's background is also quite different from what we
eventually ended up with (including the fact that he was widowed, a piece I
pulled away from his character for the series and held for someone like
Sheridan)....the Vorlons were warlike, squabbling aliens....

This was the first attempt to put B5 down on paper, in a process that would
change and evolve over the next 5 years.  Ideas that were never used,
characters who would never be seen again, the first stirrings of the Minbari
War story (including a never used alternate explanation for why they
surrendered), Delenn was a male character... Kosh had a mate who came with him
to B5...on and on and on.

Second: The original Season One Babylon 5 Writer's Bible

This massive tome weighs in at over 60 pages, with comprehensive backgrounds on
all the characters as well as guidelines for writing SF for TV in ways that
would be different than all of our predecessors.  It lays out the first year of
the arc and warns potential writers away from areas we plan to explore in later
years, has additional backgrounds on regular characters never actually used in
the series (such as a strange fellow named Mr. Jones who would have been
alternately a bane and ally to Garibaldi), stories that would eventually be
filmed, other stories that would never be used, information on the the history
and technology of the B5 universe, Psi Corps, Earthforce, the various
governments, and other areas...this is the Big One, the Grail of the B5
fictional world.  The table of contents alone covers 2 pages.

This bible was ONLY given to prospective writers, who were in turn asked to
keep the material totally confidential.  The treatment was ONLY given to
network/studio. heads and others in a position to buy the series.

In addition, BOTH of these documents will be peppered with the original
illustrations by Peter Ledger used to sell and visualize the series in its
earliest stage, including the original keyhole logo, many of them reproduced in
full color, others b&w.  Some of these images have shown up in various places,
but others will be seen here by the world at large for the first time.

(Note: the page counts given do NOT include the pages of artwork, which expand
the length further.)

I debated long and hard about whether or not I would ever make these available,
but finally decided to give in to the many requests for the release of this
material.  

This material will shortly be made available at www.thestation.com and via
phone orders.  I don't know how long we'll make them available, but I suspect
it may not be very long.  

In reading through the documents, it's like taking a trip back through time to
what was, to the very beginnings of the series, what would be, what might've
been, what never was...what got abandoned on the side of the road, what was
kept.  At times the material is coy, informative, deliberately misleading in a
couple of places where I wanted to avoid leaks, rude and sometimes it actually
makes a rough kind of sense.

They're going to cost a bit more than the scripts, because at 60+ pages in the
case of the bible, and with the color illustrations, they're more expensive to
produce, and we're only doing a limited number of these.  

Expect the full info to go up on thestation.com in a few days.

We've had other examples in the show of someone sending a telepathic signal to

First, is this CD by any chance licensed?  

Second, that is the going price for actual, physical scripts.  Go to any other
place in town, X-Files, or a script store, and that's the going price to get an
actual script.  Lots and lots of folks don't want just a CD, they want the
physical script.  I can get all of an Mark Twain's books on CD, but I *prefer*

The first was a story that Larry looked at in the treatment and suggested would

I think that we have a British/American misunderstanding here, because the
gesture reported is not designated as one that calls the person asking the
question a "wanker," at least not in this country, though it may be in the UK. 
It's more meant here as indicating that the person talking doesn't have a clue
and is just jerking around with the answer.

Though it's a moot point, since SFX is a fairly useless publication on just
about every imaginable front.  Never have so many jumped-up fanboys done so

Subject: Re: ATTN: JMS - 200 page document

First, you have to understand that there is no requirement that I release
*everything* that has ever been done for the show, and that I do have some
rights to privacy, and to keep some things for myself.

Second, the original document was such that is was random notes bunched
together by time and character, sometimes cross-referenced, sometimes not. 
It's like an outline to oneself that is never supposed to make sense to someone
else because it was never *written* for someone else.  They are my private
notes, to myself.

Where does anyone here have a problem with the concept of private notes?

Further still...the material contains bunches of quick premises for possible
stories or episodes, some used, some not, and if I let them out then those
not-used stories can never be used, and may end up elsewhere.

Lots of people seem to have this idea that the final result was widely
divergent from the original arc, hence this interest, and that proceeds from a
false premise.  It really didn't change that much.  Anyone looking at the S1
bible right now sees stuff that was laid out for the later seasons, and it was
pretty much all done...right down to telling writers not to get Lyta into a
relationship because she would eventually become starstruck by Byron, and I
didn't want anything else to get in the way of that.

So it really *isn't* that different.  What the original material *is* is
scattergun, written in quick fragments or sudden thoughts dashed down in the
middle of the night or while working on something...it's in no condition to
release to anyone.  I'd have to go through the material, reorganize it in a way
that would be all-chronological or all character, take out the stuff that I
would want to hold onto for future use...and then it wouldn't *be* the original
document anymore.

Whereas the overall approach was there from the git-go, the details were always
a work in progress, refining the ideas further and further during the five
years it took to sell the darned thing.  Imagine five years of random notes as
the story coalesced, and you've got a pretty solid idea of the mess it looks
like.

>JMS how often would you refer to this 200 page document yourself?  Did you
>refer to it as much through out season 5 as you did the first season?  

Yeah, I referred to it constantly.  Early on, to expedite things, since it is
such a clutter, I broke out each season at the very start of S1, putting each
episode on a card in a black binder, which had two-sided sheets that held 10
cards per side.

I did this for all five seasons before we ever shot a frame of film on S1.

That binder sat on the first shelf on the left in my office for five years. 
People would come in and ask where the material was, and I'd explain that the
original material was in the triple-encrypted file...and they never knew that
the distillation of that material was sitting right behind them, close enough
to reach over and pull down off the shelf.

>Did you
>have a similar document for Crusades or was Crusades included in the

Not as lengthy, no.

>Several weeks ago I remember you saying
>something about the final fate of a few of the major characters.  Does this

There's a lot of that in it as well, on the theory that even if I never used
it, *I* would have to know what it was, in terms of the history of the B5
universe and where it and the characters were all going.

You must understand: if you go through all of my files, for all the scripts and
stories I have written, you will find ONLY final drafts.  I routinely destroy
ALL of my annotated drafts, rough drafts, preliminary drafts and most notes.  I
think that, in the end, what has to stand or fall is the work, and one doesn't
let out one's rough drafts or unfinished work.  

A while back, there was a long and heated debate between me and some other
online folks on the issue of unfinished work and annotated drafts; I'm
foursquare against them being released posthumously.  This, to me, falls under
the same heading.

All the rough-draft stories, all the MSW scripts, and all my B5 scripts with my
handwritten edits, changes, annotations, deletions, and revisions...are mulch. 
As they should be.

Subject: jms recommends....

Flumadine.  You've never heard of flumadine?  

Lemme explain, 'cause this stuff just saved my ass.

Flumadine has to be taken within 48 hours of contracting the flu, which I just
recently got.  (After you've had pneumonia, as I did about a year and a half
ago, it makes you much more susceptible to flu and upper respiratory infections
and the like...and I'm susceptible to begin with, you can set your flu-calendar
by me).

What does it do?  It's a prescription drug that produces an enzyme that blocks
reproduction of the virus.  So what you have in the first 48 hours is all you
have, and those die off in time.  The result is that your symptoms are cut by
about 50%, and the duration can be similalry cut.

It's only been out for about a year, so most folks don't know about it...even
most of the staff at the medical center didn't know about it, though the doctor
was familiar with it.  I figured, having gotten the flu, I didn't have anything
to lose by taking a shot.

And sonuvagun...it worked.

So I commend it to you heartily.  Just remember, though: if you think you're
getting the flu, you *have* to get it within the first 48 hours or it won't be
effective.

But of course the definition is key to asking and answering the question. 
Unless one can say what one means one can never mean what one says.  If you're
talking about an immortal soul that goes to heaven or hell...then my answer is
no.  If you're talking about the personality, as in "she's a very soulful
person," or having a lot of soul in one's work...then that's a whole different
*concept*, and in that case being more psychological than spiritual, then the
answer is yes.

Subject: Re: jms Tells the Chris Carter/CBS story at Loscon

Just to jump in a bit...

The irony of course is that if Harsh Realm had been canceled even a week later,
we would've concluded the deal with CBS for the show I'd created and which
Chris, Frank Spotnitz and I would exec produce.  CBS had agreed to a pilot
production deal, and they were haggling over the per episode license fee should
the show get picked up for series when HR got canceled and the ripple effect
started.

The other thing I wanted to mention is that in my years in the biz, I have
rarely enjoyed a partnership with anyone as much as with Chris and Frank, who
are not only stand-up guys, but in all of our discussions I don't think a
single idea got broached that didn't make sense.  

Their approach is the same we had at B5: you check your ego at the door and do
what's best for the story.  I have nothing but good things to say about them,
and even though Fox felt that they needed to go forth only with 100% CC after
HR was canceled (the logic being that it didn't work because Chris didn't
actually create it), I consider the experience a positive one.

They're good people over there at 1013.

Correct.  Note the use of the word *starstruck*, not *involved with*.  The
theory was that Byron would have gotten involved with Ivanova, who -- feeling
she'd messed up by being too closed off to a somewhat similar person decides to
take a chance with someone, only to have it blow up in her face -- while Lyta
suffered from unrequited love (a constant B5 theme), which would no less fuel

To a certain extent.  After the PR for Rising Stars got going, Howard Chaykin

You can't apply one situation against another; their license on B5 is solid and
by contract until the end of 2001 or thereabouts.  To pull B5 would breach WB's
contract with TNT, and they would be liable.

Subject: various from jms

Some overall quick notes, just some business and housekeeping stuff to get out
of the way....

1) It looks like the genie.com site and address will be unreachable after the
first of January, so anyone using that email address for me should delete it.

2) By a similar token, after the first of the year I'm going to be
quasi-retiring the jmsatb5@aol.com email address, since technically I'm *not*
at B5 anymore, and I'm kind of clearing the decks for other stuff in future.  I
won't delete the ID, because at AOL but rather let it go dormant, because if
you delete it somebody else can begin using it soon after, but I'll gradually
be shifting over to the new address, straczynski@aol.com in terms of answering
email.  

3) Folks sending fan mail to the cast should do so at the fan club mail address
rather than the Ventura Blvd. address, because that's soon going to be set
aside for only personal stuff.

4) My Last Word column in the new B5 Magazine (as well as the one in the issue
prior to this) got foreshortened by about 50% due to an apparent glitch at the
magazine.  So if it ends kinda whacky, that's the reason for it.  They'll
reprint the whole thing in an upcoming issue (and such errors will not occur in
future).

5) The Paul Harper wedding is off, I've decided instead to stay in the bathroom
all night and cry.

Thankyew.

1) Many folks have sent me email asking when Rising Stars #3 comes out...it
actually came out about a week ago.  So it's still out there, though copies are
starting to get hard to find.

2) For folks who are mainly planning to stay home New Year's Eve and watch the
apocalypse happen on national TV...a special 2 hour edition of 48 Hours airs
that night, with the Future being its topic.  Oddly, they thought I might have
a thing or two to say about it, so in theory (at least until they develop the

Subject: don't abuse jms email

Those of you know know the drill can ignore this.  The rest....

I've said it here again and again: If you have a technical question, post it to
the newsgroup.  MY PRIVATE EMAIL IS TO BE USED ONLY FOR PRIVATE MATTERS THAT
CANNOT BE DISCUSSED PUBLICLY FOR WHATEVER LEGITIMATE REASON.

Also, series on the air or not, DO NOT SEND ME STORY IDEAS, or send me a note
with a question you're asking for a fanfic thing you're writing and then
proceed to tell me the story as it's "not a story idea, it's the story I'm
writing for my fanfic publication."  Only an idiot cannot perceive that these
two are the same thing.

Yet, despite this request, I continue to get constant email broaching those two
requests, really the only ones I've put in, and I don't think they're asking
too much.  And now they're starting to come in email to the straczynski@aol.com
address.

I'm appending just one of the endless such notes I get these days as an example
of something that could be just as well posted publicly, and has a zillion
questions, which if I answered every one, for every email I get, I would do
nothing else, ever, at any time.

Folks, and you know who you are, either you play by the few small rules I've
asked you to honor, or I'm going to have to start closing off my email address
to only people I know...because I use those addresses for business and I have
to wade through ten thousand "what's the defense grid EMP output?" type
messages to find the mail I have to answer.

I don't want to have to do that, but if I continue to get essentially spammed
with this sort of thing, I will.

So do NOT send me the following sort of note.  Please honor the request
detailed above (and sending me a note that says, "I know you said not to send
you this kind of note, but this is just a one-time question" doesn't work
because there are FIFTEEN MILLION of you with "one-time questions".)

I've always tried to maintain an open email policy, but it really is starting
to get abused beyond the point where I can handle it efficiently.

Thank you.

Subj:	 A question about tech, the novels, etc.
Date:	12/16/1999 9:39:39 AM Pacific Standard Time
From:	
To:	straczynski@aol.com

I already sent you an email to your Jmsatb5@aol.com addy, so I will not make 
this one tremendously long, because you'll have my other questions to answer 
if you can get to them :)

1.)  White Stars - did the Minbari actually have the ability to build more?  
I know that Delenn mentions around season 3 that the "First Wave" of White 
Stars have been built, yet around Season five, Sheridan's comments about 
"running out" eventually make it sound like they cannot build them anymore.  
Is this a case?

2.) Some discussion amongst some friends and I have centered around a 
definition for a "Defense grid."   Did you or anyone involved in B5 actually 
define what a defense grid is? (I know that, at least for EF, its 
interceptors and possibly ECM - is there more than just stealth or 
interceptors to a defense grid?  Some speculation has included "EM Fields" 
or "grav-fields" like some pseudo-shield technology, but I am wondering what 
you have to say on this.)

3.) Does ANY race on bablyon 5 use anti-matter based weaponry, or a type of 
reactor system?  I recall a quote from SEason five from Franklin dealing 
with the nature of weapons, and "disrupting" is mentioned, which is why i 
asked. Also, do Minbari employ some sort of "Forcefield" in their weaponry?  
I noticed that in In the Beginning, their tractor beams emitted from the 
weapons emittors it would seem, so I ask because of this.

4.) Vorlons and Shadows:  another discussion between me and some other 
people considered whether or not the shadows employed nanotechnology in 
their ships, rather than a more "biological" or "Cellular" approach for the 
Vorlons.  Further, I was wondering if Vorlon and Shadow technology each 
reflected their beliefs (The Vorlons favor a more "Evolutionary" approach - 
they keep most of the same tech over a long period but refine it to great 
degrees, making it more powerful, while the Shadows seem to appear to favor 
many new and different approachs.. more revolutionary.)

5.) Once in a comment you made reference to "gravimetric drives" on the 
White Star being based on magnetic and gravitic principles - is this 
something that you received from your tech advisors (JPL I think?)

6.) I've noticed that with the demise of Crusade, a large influx of novels 
seems to have started again...  is the B5 universe moving to a print media?  
Or have you considered this?  (By the way, have the Technomage books you 
mentioned Jeanne Cavelos, sorry If I misspelled her name, come out to your 
knowledge?  I really enjoyed book 7, and have been wondering.)

7.)  Just two verification notes, if you could.  In "Final Reckoning", we 
learn Lyta apparently is dead.   Did she die during the telepath war, and if 
so, was Bester involved?  (And do we learn in any way how she dies?)

Secondly, I ran across a note that you had made a interview in a magazine 
called "Dreamwatch" that talked about technomage technology, and had 
mentioned that the Shadows had "loaned" technology to the technomages, and 
if so, was ALL their technology shadow based, or did they have more beyond 
that (IE other technology from other races, or their own tech) and you had 
also mentioned that the reason the technomages left was to avoid repaying 
the debt.  I missed the issue, so I am just wondering if you had mentioned 
those things, and if there is anything you are allowed to add, or any 
summary that i might have neglected mentioning or got wrong.

I'd heard this rumor the other day, and called Jerry to see if it were true or
not.  Well, he called back, and it's true.  He's running for US Congress in the
24th district, state of California (just north of the valley).  

I differ with Jerry on just about every one of his political views, always
have, but I think that his entering the race is great.  And while our views
differ, the thing about Jerry is that he talks straight and you always know
where he stands on an issue, no waffling.  So on that basis alone I think it'd
be great if he won.  I don't have to agree with his positions to respect their
origin, and the forthrightness with which they are expressed.

Go get 'em, Jer.

Not correct.  

The book felt massively padded to me.  For instance, we're into the vault in
the movie within about 3 minutes.  That segment was stretched out to something
like 20 pages or more.  

I went through and made indications were the padding should be cut out...and
after it was all cut, there was only about two-thirds of a book left.  It
needed a b-story or elemen to flesh it out, which Peter and others did with the
novelizations, but wasn't done here.  So I asked Fiona to come up with one,
since I was frantic at the time with production and we didn't get any
indication from Del Rey of a desire to come up with one.  She did so, writing
out a detailed outline that fit and worked well.  There was no money involved,
she did it just to help, and asked only for a small credit somewhere in the
book, along the lines of "additional material supplied by...." 

In any event, the process dragged on, and it didn't seem to work out, and
finally the book was jointly killed.  It's obvious the author tried her best,
but we look for a kind of approach that fits in with the rest of the books, and
this one just didn't work on that level.

If the author is slamming our reference editor, that's unfortunate, because it
was my call on the book from start to finish.

Here's what you have to know about that cut.  Go look at the back cover.  See
that massive drum off to the left, the one twice as big as a person?  Now look
at the front cover.  See the guys standing there with the sticks in front of a
smaller version of that drum?  Those sticks weigh something like 5-10 pounds
each.  They hold those sticks high above their heads to reach the drum, one in
particular who keeps the main beat going, and they keep doing that for the full
length of that track, which is an astonishing accomplishment.  You think he's
going to fall over after a while.

When I heard that, and saw the video, my first thought was, "Ah, well, there's
someone else who knows what it felt like to make B5."

Thanks.  You have to understand that what we did was to make the jackets

I always start with character.  Character gives you plot; if you start with
plot and try to back your way into characater, you can go afoul very easily.

You have to know who your character is, what he wants, how far he will go to
get it, and how far someone else will go to stop him.  Answer those questions
and 90% of the plotting work is done for you.

I can't give permission because WB owns the rights to those characters, not me.
 And I think they would still view it as a form of copyright infringement.

Subject: Third AMAZING STORIES Story

The first one was a Londo story because I really wanted to do something
different and cool with the character, go inside his head and show the
transition to being emperor, let folks know that inside he was still the same
Londo...the second one with Lyta and G'Kar was mainly for fun, to play with
them and see their relationship together out there.

The third, which I just finished and turned in to Amazing Stories, and which
will appear I think around May, was written with one express purpose: to set
the proverbial cat amongst the proverbial pigeons with something that's going
to send a ripple all through B5 fandom; it's a story I don't think anyone ever
expected to see.

Just the first line alone should stun a number of B5 folks

And that's all I'm going to say about it.  But just know...there's a real
toad-strangler coming up in May.

(And Rising Stars 4 is out now.)

No, nor will it ever.  That's how Hollywood bookkeeping works.  We know,
because e were told, that when the show was still first airing on PTEN, it was
a mandate that ALL PTEN shows had to show a profit every season in order to be
renewed.  That was a hard and fast rule.  

Each year, we got renewed, because we made a profit for WB.  Once, in a meeting
with the execs after year 3, they complimented us on how much money the show
had made for WB.

Then they turn right around and, for purposes of net participation, pump out
balance sheets that show we'll forever be in the red.

Net means nothing because they can continue to charge anything and everything
against the revenue, and you can never show a profit on paper; it's only if you
own a piece of the gross that actual money appears.

Actually, TC is really getting that part together; 4 came one month after 3,

hitting the next deadline, or damn close to it.

Five, by the way, is probably the strongest issue of the bunch, and definitely

1) Not every single so-called religious person is a good person, as Jimmy
Swaggart and his ilk have shown.  I portray that which is appropriate to the
story.  Having done some very even handed stuff on religion on B5, I don't feel
I have anything to prove on this issue.

>How would you characterize network interaction (notes, suggestions,

>of Crusade?

Our scripts were reviewed at WB by our liaison, Gregg Maday, who from time to
time would call with what was basically a question.  "I'm wondering if we may
need to clarify X for the audience," or "Is there some way to strengthen this
element?"  In each case, the conversation was left with, "I'll leave the
disposition of this to your discretion." 

The thing about Gregg's notes or suggestions were that they were generally
well-considered, thoughtful, and totally aimed at making the story work.  So we
always got along great.  

And by the time season 2 rolled around, we got a couple of notes on the first
couple of episodes, then that was literally that...we were on our own after
that.  He trusted us to do the right thing by the story, and we never violated
that trust.

>I'd have thought that after writing/producing five full seasons of Babylon
>5, any network would have let you alone based upon your recent track record.

Yeah, one would think that...though that's also what Rod Serling thought after
doing Twilight Zone, only to find himself torpedoed amidships creatively during
Night Gallery.

There are always peaks and valleys; the first bunch of Rising Star issues were
really establishing the rules and who some of the characters are; the fact that
the murders are going on, the possible motive, and introducing a bunch of
suspects.

Now all that pipe has been laid, and I can start to really move the arc of the
story forward, do more in present-tense than in flashback.  That's kind of
where the fun really kicks in.

About the only film of that period that's more unsettling is SECONDS, with (of
