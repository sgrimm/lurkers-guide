 I have some news that must be imparted.  I think that the best way
 to convey that news is to start at the end of the story, make my
 way to the middle, and end at the beginning.

 So: the end of the story.

 Everything is okay.  Nothing major really changes.  All is well.

 Now the middle of the story.

 I've been asked, several times, what happens if something *happens*
 to me, or one of the cast members, during the five year arc, since
 this is a fully-worked-out novel.  Generally, I blow off the question
 with humor.  But the truth is, obviously, I've taken every possible
 step to make sure that no one is disappointed.  In my case, I've
 made sure the story is available somewhere.

 The trouble, of course, is that unlike writing a novel, where the
 characters exist only on a sheet of paper, actors and writers are
 some discussion on the best of days).  They can get sick, they can
 get into contract disputes, they can be hit by meteors, they can
 decide to buy a house in Cambridge and raise hedgehogs under an
 assumed name.  There are, in short, *always* unpredictables in any
 such endeavor.

 Consequently, in drafting the story for Babylon 5, I made sure to
 compensate for any possible changes.  For lack of a better term,
 there is a "trap door" built into the storyline for every character.
 Obviously, you don't want to lose anyone, but in *every* case any
 such change momentarily shifts the story about ten degrees to one
 side for a little bit, and then you're back on track again.

 Case in point: Dr. Benjamin Kyle and Lyta Alexander.  Here are the
 only two humans who have seen or scanned a Vorlon.  This is Very
 Important to the storyline.  Alas, as later events unfolded, things
 did not work out, and the characters were dropped...but their story
 remained important, in that it was established that they were soon
 afterward recalled to Earth under mysterious circumstances (as noted
 in "War Prayer"), which actually *helps* the storyline in many ways.

 This is not meant to sound callous.  As a writer, and as a producer,
 it's my job to tell the story, to be responsible, and to make sure
 every possible contingency is covered.  To do anything less would be
 simply irresponsible.

 Now to the beginning of the story.

 Over the last few weeks, we've been re-activating our cast, making
 the deals for the coming season.  One aspect of this has been a
 series of conversations with Michael O'Hare.  Having produced one
 full season, and having learned a lot, and having fine-tuned the
 "saga" along the way, it was our goal to expand the show, bring in
 some new characters, and take the show in some new directions, which
 will prove quite interesting, I think.  (One sidelight to all this:
 now that we've established the series, we'll be able to spend a bit
 more time on personal stories, to let our audience learn more about
 the characters, particularly the humans, who kinda got short shrift
 this season.)

 There is also the question, from an actor's point of view, about
 other opportunities, any possible concern about typecasting, the
 limitations of a continuing role (and the role of the commander
 does have some definite "walls," giving more freedom in many ways
 to other characters).  Now is the point where one needs to take
 a breath and assess one's future, because the deeper we get into
 the story, the more problematic it is to change things (though,
 again, it's do-able, as noted above).

 As a result of these discussions, it has been agreed that we will
 have a separation, in the role of the commander.  Let me emphasize
 this very clearly, so there is no chance of miscommunication: this
 is a mutual, amicable, and friendly separation.  This isn't a Tasha
 Yar situation.  Moreover, we will be handling this in such a way
 that, down the road, Sinclair could potentially return to the story.

 The character of Sinclair will achieve an important destiny, and the
 mystery of the Battle of the Line will be explained, both in the
 first episode of the new season.  His story will still track.  And
 the series will still track precisely as planned.  I take pains to
 mention this because both Michael and I want it clear that we both
 believe in the show, and want this in no way to interfere with the
 series.  He has asked me to convey for him his encouragement, his
 best wishes, and to emphasize that this is, again, an amicable and
 friendly separation.

 He has said that he is happy to continue to do the conventions, to
 promote the show, because he believes in it, and because he is an
 important part of this season's success.  We can think of no
 finer ambassador for Babylon 5 at conventions than Michael O'Hare.
 He is a dynamite speaker, he cares about the fans of the show, and
 his compassion shows.  We think he's a nifty guy.

 On our part, we wish Michael only the very best.  We know that
 he is very much in demand, and look forward to seeing him in other
 projects over the next year.  This will also allow us to pursue some
 new directions avenues for the show that will help to expedite the
 overall story.  Sinclair disappearing for an indeterminate period
 after the events of "Chrysalis" will allow us to tighten the screws
 of the story, and heighten the tension of things going on in the
 storyline.

 If I can speak personally for a moment...those of you reading
 this on-line know that I've always talked straight with you.  If
 I thought this in *any* way would interfere with the story, you'd
 hear about it from me loud and clear.  When problems have arisen in
 the past, I've always spoken about them quite bluntly here (much
 to the chagrin of some people).  This is okay.  We're all still
 very much friends.  I speak frequently to Michael, and consider
 him a friend, just as he considers me a friend.  This was a hard
 decision, but we both knew that it was the right decision, for
 very different reasons.  We both kinda came to the same place
 at the same time from different directions.  We've got to do
 what's right for the show, and for each other, and in many ways,
 this does just that.

 So both we on the show, and Michael are served by this mutual and
 amicable separation.  We will go our separate ways for now, with
 the possibility of meeting Sinclair again down the road a piece,
 as Gandalf disappeared for a time into Mordor, only to return when
 needed most.  (We will also be keeping the character of Sinclair
 alive in the comic, and some of the planned novels, to keep that
 option available to us.)

 Once again, let me emphasize that the story continues on the path
 that has been set for it, everything you learn this season sill
 obtains, the show remains solid, with all of the other cast members
 coming back for a new season, and that the saga of Babylon 5 will
 continue to reveal itself exactly as planned.  And I hope you will
 continue to stay with us for that journey.

                                    Sincerely,
                                    Joe Straczynski
                                    Creator/Executive Producer
                                    BABYLON 5
